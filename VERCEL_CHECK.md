# Vercel Deployment Check

## Your changes ARE pushed to GitHub ✅
- Latest commit: `559c4e0` - "Remove authentication system..."
- Branch: `main`
- Status: Pushed to origin/main

## Why Vercel might not show changes:

1. **Vercel might still be building** - Check your Vercel dashboard for:
   - Latest deployment status
   - Build logs
   - Any errors

2. **Manual Redeploy Needed**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Find the latest deployment (should show commit `559c4e0`)
   - If it's failing or still building, wait for it to complete
   - If it's successful but site doesn't reflect changes, try "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

3. **Cache Issues**:
   - Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
   - Or wait a few minutes for CDN cache to clear

4. **Check Deployment URL**:
   - Make sure you're checking the correct Vercel URL
   - Should be: `https://sanctum-video-review.vercel.app` (or your custom domain)

## Quick Steps:
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Open your project
3. Check "Deployments" tab - look for commit `559c4e0`
4. If it shows "Building" - wait
5. If it shows "Error" - check build logs
6. If it shows "Ready" but site doesn't work - try redeploy
